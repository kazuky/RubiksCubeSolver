RubiksCubeSolver
================
It is a program for a NXT that solves a Rubik's Cube.
  
  
SPECS:


   Accuracy: 50%
   
      *Mostly because the color sensor can't detect the difference between RED and ORANGE.
      
      *If you don't set it up perfectly, it won't work ether.
      
      *There is no bug in this program.(I think...)
      
    
   Time: 4-5 min.
   
      *50 sec. to scan
      
      *15 sec. to calculate
      
      *3-4min. to solve
      
    
   # of moves: 100
   
      *Usually, it takes less than 100 moves to solve it.
      
    
    
STEPS:
  1. First, it scans every face of the cube.
  2. Inside of the NXT's mind, it solves the cube to confirm that there is no flow in Scanning.
  3. Inside of the NXT's mind, it solves the cube 3 more times differently and compare which one requires the least steps.
  4. It solves the cube with the least steps.
